# LocInfer
Find the location for a Twitter user based on his/her neighbors
Given a set of seed users in an geographical area, a set of candidate user, and the network connection between then, 
userDiscover.java finds the users from the candidate set who are in the same area with high probability.

We use zip compression and min-heap to reduce the memory requirement and computation time.
